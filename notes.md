to build the app: yarn create react-app my-app

Challenges to complete:

[X] turn string into an object that counts the number of times a letter appeared in the string
[X] build a React component with a button that increased the counter
[X] make counter display the fizz-buzz algo
[X] determine how to make the function multiply(5)(6) return 30 using nested functions.
****************
[X] Build a react class component called hello that returns an h1 of “Hello”.
[X] Build a constructor that could accept props and set an initial state of helloTranslations set to an empty array.
[X] You have a fake endpoint ‘https://hello/translations’, you have access to it as this.props.helloTranslations. Set up a componentDidMount and a fetch request to the endpoint.
  *remember fetch syntax
[X] That data returns an array data.translations = ['Hola', 'Bonjour', 'Hello', etc.], access that array and set your state of helloTranslations equal to that array but exclude 'Hello'.
[X]  iterate through the data in your state and make each translation a button inside an li.
    display that data: <li><button>Hola</button></li>
    *remember to invoke renderTranslations and to return the mapped data
[X] write a function that when the button is clicked, it console.logs the translation
[X] Awesome, do it again with a functional component
